<h4>Why is the Dark Knight my number one pick?<br></h4>
The Dark Knight became my all-time favorite movie of DC movies because of Heath Ledger and his legendary performance as
the joker. He took a complex and crazy character like The Joker and turned him into a chaos agent whose mission was
creating as much destruction, and ruin in Gotham as possible, with a goal to create fear doubt and uncertainty among the
people of Gotham. The writing was spectacular, the performance from all the leads was immaculate, and the musical score
was amazing<br>
<h5>Overall I rate The Dark Knight a 10/10</h5>

<h3>2. Joker</h3>

<h4>Why is Joker my number two pick?</h4>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the classic Batman villain not only matches up to the late Heath Ledger's portrayal in
    The Dark Knight, but it gave a side of the Joker that hasn't been seen in any other media. He is a mentally broken
    and abused man who performs as a clown for a living, takes care of his ailing mother, all while working toward his
    dream of one day being on TV. As a person who has had to deal with severe mental health problems in the past, I
    heavily sympathized with the struggles he faced dealing with an economic system that is not kind nor forgiving for
    those that have trouble living a mentally stable lifestyle. When he was frustrated, I too felt frustrated, when he
    was angry, I felt that same anger. Relatable character, amazing script, great cast of characters and would recommend
    this movie for anyone looking for a movie to anyone, even those that don't like superhero movies. </p>
<h5>Overall I rate Joker a 9.5/10</h5>

<h3>3. The Batman</h3>

<h4>Why is The Batman my number three pick?</h4>
<p>What set this movie apart for me from the other Batman films is the direction they went with Batman as a character. The focus this time is showing off Batman as a detective, and showing the audience why he is known as the world's greatest detective. And I also like that this Batman is younger, less experienced, but is also determined to solve the big conspiracy that has been bubbling under Gotham for decades: The corruption. Leading up the movie I did have my doubts about Robert Pattinson but, after seeing him in the role, I can say for sure he did the character justice and did a fantastic job in playing the role. I'd say my favorite thing in this movie is the soundtrack. Everytime someone asks me my favorite thing in this movie I always point to the score, done by the great Michael Giacchino. His score breathed life and depth into every scene in the movie, and when things got intense, the music amped up alongside the scenes. Michael Giacchino score had to be my favorite among the other films I had mentioned.
