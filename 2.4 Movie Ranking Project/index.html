<h4>Why is the Dark Knight my number one pick?<br></h4>
The Dark Knight became my all-time favorite movie of DC movies because of Heath Ledger and his legendary performance as
the joker. He took a complex and crazy character like The Joker and turned him into a chaos agent whose mission was creating as much destruction, and ruin in Gotham as possible, with a goal to create fear doubt and uncertainty among the people of Gotham. The writing was spectacular, the performance from all the leads was immaculate, and the musical score was amazing<br><br>
<p>Overall I rate The Dark Knight a 10/10</p>

<h3>2. Joker</h3>
